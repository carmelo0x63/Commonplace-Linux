# `awk`: pattern-directed scanning and processing language
Awk scans each input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified either on the command line or in multiple file(s). With each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed when a line of a file matches the pattern. Each line is matched against the pattern portion of every pattern-action statement; the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.

AWK is, in fact, an acronym. It takes its name from the initial of its inventors: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan.

### Test file
The file we'll be testing against is below.
```
aaa = 111
bbb = 222
abc = 999
ccc = 333
ddd = 444
```

### Show lines between pattern(s)
```
$ awk '/bbb/,/ccc/' test.txt
bbb = 222    ### only lines between "bbb"
abc = 999
ccc = 333    ### ... and "ccc" are displayed
```

### Re-format stream on-the-fly
```
$ awk '{ print $3 ": " $1}' test.txt
111: aaa
222: bbb
999: abc
333: ccc
444: ddd
```
**NOTE**: `$0` is the whole line
